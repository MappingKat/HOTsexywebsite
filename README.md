HOTsexywebsite
==============

This name probably sounds a little naughty, but it is actually a map of HOT's activations...

The images refer to different types of HOT Activations.  I have not quite nailed them all down, but here is what I came 
up with so far:

![HOT1](https://raw.github.com/MappingKat/HOTsexywebsite/master/HOT.png)= Emergency Response Mapping (floods, earthquakes, 
drought, conflict, etc)

![HOT2](https://raw.github.com/MappingKat/HOTsexywebsite/master/HOT2.png)= Prevention Mapping

![HOT3](https://raw.github.com/MappingKat/HOTsexywebsite/master/HOT3.png)= Community Mapping

![HOT4](https://raw.github.com/MappingKat/HOTsexywebsite/master/HOT4.png)= Simulation

![HOT4](https://raw.github.com/MappingKat/HOTsexywebsite/master/HOT5.png)= ...


Over and out.
