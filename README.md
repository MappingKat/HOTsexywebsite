HOTsexywebsite
==============

This name probably sounds a little naughty, but it is actually a map of HOT's activations... 

![homepage](http//www.github.com/blob/Mappingkat/HOTsexywebsite/homepage.png)

The images refer to different types of HOT Activations.  I have not quite nailed them all down, but here is what I came 
up with so far:

![HOT1](http//www.github.com/blob/Mappingkat/HOTsexywebsite/HOT1.png)= Emergency Response Mapping (floods, earthquakes, 
drought, conflict, etc)

![HOT2](http//www.github.com/blob/Mappingkat/HOTsexywebsite/HOT2.png)= Prevention Mapping

![HOT3](http//www.github.com/blob/Mappingkat/HOTsexywebsite/HOT3.png)= Community Mapping

![HOT4](http//www.github.com/blob/Mappingkat/HOTsexywebsite/HOT1.png)=

![HOT4](http//www.github.com/blob/Mappingkat/HOTsexywebsite/HOT4.png)= Simulation


Over and out.
